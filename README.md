## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- Hide/show the board sidebar
- Toggle the theme between light/dark modes
- **Bonus**: Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - Python framework
- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) - Library to access modern browser features
- [Hyperscript](https://hyperscript.org/) - Front-end scripting language
- [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Relational database

### Architecture

#### Models

   1. Board 
      - related to  Django User model with foreign key
      - custom save method to return saved object

   2. Column
      - related to Board model with foreign key

   3. Task
      - related to Column with foreign key
      - custom save method to return saved object

   4. Subtask 
      - related to Task with foreign key

#### Views

   1. index
      - finds user boards from db if user logged in
      - renders base template

   2. get_sidebar
      - finds user boards from db if user logged in
      - renders sidebar component
   
   ##### Requires login

   3. board_detail
      - login required
      - finds users' board using id in url and all columns of the board
      - renders board_detail template

   4. board_form
      - on get request creates board form and empty column formset
      - on post request, validates forms
      - if forms are valid, it saves a new board then uses that board's id when saving columns. Then returns a 204 HTTP response.
      - renders board_form component

   5. edit_board
      - finds board using url id
      - creates a board form using returned board
      - if forms are valid, it saves the board and updates or deletes (if marked for deletion) columns. Then returns a 204 HTTP response
      - renders edit_board_form component

   6. column_form
      - adds a form to the column formset
      - builds a new formset using current_total_formsets from url and build_new_formset helper function
      - passes new_formset and new_total_formsets in context
      - renders column_form component

   7. delete_board and delete_task
      - finds object to delete and creates delete form
      - if form is valid, deletes object and redirects to index

   8. new_task
      - finds board from id in url
      - on get request creates task form and empty subtask formset
      - on post request, validates forms
      - changes the column queryset of the task_form to contain only columns from current board
      - if forms are valid, it saves a new task then uses that task's id when saving subtasks. Then returns a 204 HTTP response.
      - renders task_form component

   9. edit_task
      - finds task and board from id and t_id in url           
      - creates a task form using returned task
      - changes the column queryset of the task_form to contain only columns from current board
      - if forms are valid, it saves the task and updates or deletes (if marked for deletion) subtasks. Then returns a 204 HTTP response
      - renders edit_task_form component

   10. task_view
      - finds task and board from id and t_id in url
      - on get request, creates task form using returned task. Creates taskview formset (as subtask_formset) filtering by returned task and ordering by is_completed (completed items are first).
      - changes the column queryset of the task_form to contain only columns from current board
      - on post request, forms are validated and any column changes and subtask is_completed changes are saved. Then returns a 204 HTTP response     
      - renders task_view component

    11. subtask_form
      - adds a form to the subtask formset
      - builds a new formset using current_total_formsets from url and build_new_formset helper function
      - passes new_formset and new_total_formsets in context
      - renders subtask_form component

#### Auth Views

    1. signup

    2. login 

    3. logout

#### Forms
    
    1. Board form

    2. Delete board form

    3. Column form

    6. Task view form

    7. Subtask form

  ##### Formsets

    2. forms (add modals functionality)




forms - django has different types of forms you can use: form class, models forms, formsets
views - class views, function views
testing - unit tests
sqlite - development
db queries and speed

setting up venv

also doing cs50 python

It took me a while to understand django forms and getting it to work with the projects' design. I did make some small changes with the form functionality with the column and subtask fields / forms. And the way one deletes them to make it work. Also added a save changes button to the task view form. 

htmx - how to send requests / vs using regular form requests   
     - what to do on form success (include js code)

things i added:
 - authentication
 - loading spinner

looking to add:
 - notifications when updating/creating , deleting 
 - drag and drop 


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
